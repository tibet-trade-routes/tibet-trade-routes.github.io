                This dynamic map below shows the evolution of trade routes and the flow of people in and around Tibet from the beginning of
                the 20th century (1900s) to the present-day. The black lines represent trade routes around the year 1900. The green lines
                represent modern-day high-speed rail networks in China that connect to Tibet. Click on a trade route or rail line to find
                out its name. The blue dots represent cities and other important stops along the trade routes. One interesting thing to note
                is routes that parallel the historical <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/silk-road/">Silk Road</a>,
                which is represented by the top two green lines and existed from the second century BCE to the mid-15th century. The
                centrality of Lhasa is also a common thread between the two time periods - this is depicted by having the dots move toward
                Lhasa.
